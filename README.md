# TwoFace

Simple two factor authentication Registration and Login Page using Microsoft Face API for verification and detection.
Users are stored in a JSON file, which can be uploaded to a backend if you are using one, otherwise by default it runs on localhost and local machine directory.
 
# Use

Run a `npm install` in the `Face-Login` as well as the `Login-and-Registration-Page` directories. Go to the website directory, open app.js and edit the API Subscription Key and Region accordingly. Finally go back to the `Face-Login` as well as the `Login-and-Registration-Page` and run `npm start` on both. Then open your browser and go to `localhost:8181` to see the app in action
